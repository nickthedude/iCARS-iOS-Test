h1. iOS iCars Test

To run the app, either download the .zip file or clone the rep locally.

Once downloaded/cloned open the Xcode workspace file located within the repo: iCarsCodingTest.xcworkspace (Note: Make sure you open the workspace file (iCarsCodingTest.xcworkspace) and not the project file(iCarsCodingTest.xcodeproj))

To run the app, make sure the 'iCarsCodingTest' target is selected, then select a simulator type or build to your device with a developer provisioning profile. Then hit the "play" / Run button.  

Note:To run on actual device you'll probably have to switch the 'Team' on the 'iCarsCodingTest' target.
